# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  The client was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that is dedicated to catering to their customers' individual needs. They develop financial plans specifically for each customer, while also prioritizing the safety of their data. The company wanted me to add additional security to their current application.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  The part I did best was documenting the vulnerabilities and suppressing the false positives. It is important to code securely because the information the company handles is very sensitive and should be protected from those who would try to access it illegally.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The most challenging part of the assessment was setting up the self-signed certificate and turning the HTTP into HTTPS. I could not figure out why the application would not start after adjusting the application.properties file multiple times.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I increased the layers of security by using input validation, cryptography, secure error handling, API interactions, and following the highest standards and practices.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I made certain the code and software application were functional and secure by reviewing the code and testing it to ensure it ran as expected. I ran an initial dependency test, refactored the code, and ran another check to ensure all vulnerabilities were addressed and none were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  There are a few resources that will be  beneficial for future assignments. The top two were the secure coding practices that can be used in any future assignment, and the dependency check tool, which will help find vulnerabilities in future code.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  From this assignment, I could show future employers the original Vulnerability Assessment Report and the Updated Assessment Report, which will showcase my ability to test for vulnerabilities and suppress false positives.
